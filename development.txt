    Is important to change the module's configuration data, which are: 
        - 'api_key' (authentication key in api movies), 
        - 'price' and 'stock' (these are the default values when creating a new product, but it can be changed on the screen whenever you create a new product).


The module was developed as follows:

    1. Integration with the Movies API (admin): the integration with the API is performed on the backend, through the same endpoint used to access the movies index page. But, the pagination was done using JavaScript;
    2. Importing products (admin): An 'attribute_set' was created, which has the 'is_movie' attribute, used to represent products that are movies;
    3. InstallSchema and InstallData (admin): in addition to InstallSchema for the creation of new product attributes, a new table has also been created in the database, which serves to maintain the data regarding the movies that have been saved as favorites by customers;
    4. 'Add to favorites' button: was appended to the product view through the file “product.info.addto”;
    5. (admin) Screen to view the top 10 favorite movies: ui_components was used to create the table with the data.
